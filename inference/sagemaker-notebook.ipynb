      "4. Road trip: A road trip is a fun and flexible way to see a lot of sights in a short amount of time. You could rent a car and drive through a beautiful region, like the Pacific Coast Highway in California or the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina.\n",
      "5. Water sports: If you love being on the water, consider a vacation that focuses on water sports. You could go surfing in Bali, snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, or kayaking in the Norwegian fjords.\n",
      "6. Music festivals: Summer is a great time for music festivals, and there are plenty to choose from around the world. You could check out Coachella in California, Glastonbury in the UK, or Tomorrowland in Belgium.\n",
      "7. Family-friendly resorts: If you're traveling with kids, consider a family-friendly resort that offers plenty of activities and amenities for all ages. Many resorts offer kids' clubs, water parks, and other fun activities that are perfect for families.\n",
